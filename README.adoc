= CTUstyle3: Macros for student's theses at CTU in Prague, using OpTeX

This is version of CTUstyle (see http://petr.olsak.net/ctustyle-e.html)
for usage in OpTeX. It is derived from CTUstyle2 (new design).

This package can serve as an example of OpTeX's macro package.

See ctustyle-doc.pdf for information of how to use CTUstyle 
(sorry, this is in Czech language only, only abstract is in English).

You can see TUGboat article too https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb36-2/tb113olsak.pdf
